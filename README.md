# Reinforcement Learning Project

## Install
Make sure you have an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) environment or have manually installed python3 and libs for machine learning.<br>
Use this link to install SUMO https://eclipse.dev/sumo/ and follow instructions.

## Simulation

### Starting the simulation

After downloading SUMO, open the file named `network.sumocfg`. Clicking the start button will launch the simulation, but it may run too fast and finish quickly. To slow it down, adjust the "Delay" setting in the toolbar above.

### Editing the simulation

If you need to edit the simulation or the network, you can do so by pressing `Ctrl + T` in the SUMO-GUI application. This will open the NetEdit tool, which allows you to modify the network and the traffic as needed.
